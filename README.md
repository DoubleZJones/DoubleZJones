# Hi, I'm Tio  
I work in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, building systems that behave the same way on Monday morning as they do on Friday at 4:59 PM.

My focus is identity, security, automation, and the parts of collaboration that actually matter the things that keep environments clean, predictable, and easy to support. Most of what I build comes from real-world gaps I’ve had to close, not theoretical best practices.

This profile is a collection of the work I’ve done to make Microsoft 365 environments more stable, more secure, and easier for people to use.

---

## What I Work On
- Identity and licensing flows that don’t break when someone changes departments  
- Security and compliance controls that protect data without slowing people down  
- SharePoint and Teams environments that stay organized past the first six months  
- Telephony setups that route calls where they’re supposed to go  
- Cross-tenant sync and migration work that avoids surprises  
- Data protection, lifecycle management, and environment cleanup  
- Training and enablement that helps people actually use the tools they have

## How I Work
I like systems that are:

- predictable  
- documented  
- secure by default  
- easy to support  
- and built with the future in mind
- Always learning to make things better

I don’t chase complexity for the sake of it. I build things that last, things that scale, and things that make life easier for the people who rely on them.

## Current Focus
Building a complete engineering portfolio that reflects real Microsoft 365 work — identity, governance, automation, telephony, and everything in between.
